# Presentation

Some tips about bluetooth


# Installation

On linux, hardware access is made by hci interface.
Then install `bluez` to get `bluetoothd` daemon interact with hardware and
`bluetoothctl` tool for user to configure bluetooth through bluetoothd.


To allow multiple connected devices, ensure `MultiProfile = multiple` in
`/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`. If not, change the value and restart bluetooth
service (`systemctl restart bluetooth`)

# Bluetoothctl


Get harware devices known has Controllers

    bluetoothctl -- list
    Controller B8:27:EB:57:B4:C9 pi4chu [default]

Get known devices

    bluetoothctl -- devices
    Device 5C:F8:21:AC:80:F2 YAS-306 D971BA Bluetooth
    Device 78:5E:A2:96:55:C7 MIDDLETON

Get connected devices

    bluetoothctl -- devices Connected
    Device 5C:F8:21:AC:80:F2 YAS-306 D971BA Bluetooth

To change device, juste disconnect current and the system automaticaly connects
the next one (TODO: check this point)

    bluetoothctl -- disconnect 5C:F8:21:AC:80:F2
